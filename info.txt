The Chamber’s official seal (1906)
The Chamber’s official seal was bestowed by the Qing government in 1906. This seal is 13 cm tall and 7 cm wide. From a business history perspective, it is not only a Chamber seal, but also a testimony to a century of overseas business exchange and trade development between the Chinese entrepreneurs of modern China and Singapore. All official documents must be stamped and signed to validate the document. It shows the credibility of the document and also the integrity and credibility of the authority.
